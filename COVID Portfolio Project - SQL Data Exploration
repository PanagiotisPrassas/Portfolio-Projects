--Used dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

--//

--In order to perform Covid 19 Data Exploration
--Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

--//

--I have made 2 CSVs from the downloaded dataset CSV for Data Exploration Purposes 
--Then i have imported them to my SQL Server and to my database {CovidPortfolioProject.dbo.CovidDeaths & CovidPortfolioProject.dbo.Vaccinations}
